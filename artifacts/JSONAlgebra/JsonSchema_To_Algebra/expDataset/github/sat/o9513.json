    "description": "Initiate the background execution of a specific export (e.g. export template). Required parameters are the identity that the export belongs to, and the **id** of the export that you wish to run. This will create an instance of a running **export_file**, which is what you can monitor to determine when the export is ready to be downloaded. The **id** in the response from this call is the handle to that running export_file and what is used in future calls to check on the status of the run.\n\n_Important note: this **id** representing the handle to the running instance of the export is not always uniquely generated with each run \u2013 if you attempt to run the same export several times in close succession, you will receive back the id of the already-running instance of that export. This is a safeguard to prevent many accidental simultaneous runs of the exact same export \u2013 one must finish before a new one can be initiated._",
